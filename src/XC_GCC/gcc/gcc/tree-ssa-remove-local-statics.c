/* Converting static function-local variables to automatic variables.

   The motivating example is a function like:

   void
   foo (unsigned n)
   {
     static int var;
     unsigned i;

     for (i = 0; i != n; i++)
       {
         var = ...

         do other things with var...
       }
   }

   Because VAR is static, doing things like code motion to loads and
   stores of VAR is difficult.  Furthermore, accesses to VAR are
   inefficient.  This pass aims to recognize the cases where it is not
   necessary for VAR to be static and modify the code so that later
   passes will do the appropriate optimizations.

   The criteria for a static function-local variable V in a function F
   being converted to an automatic variable are:

   1. F does not call setjmp; and
   2. V's address is never taken; and
   3. V is not declared volatile; and
   4. V is not used in any nested function;
   5. V is not an aggregate value (union, struct, array, etc.); and
   6. Every use of V is defined along all paths leading to the use.

   NOTE: For ease of implementation, we currently treat a function call
   as killing all previous definitions of static variables, since we
   could have:

   static void
   foo (...)
   {
     static int x;

     x = ...;       (1)

    f (...);        (2)

     ... = x;       (3)
   }

   The use at (3) needs to pick up a possible definition made by the
   call at (2).  If the call at (2) does not call back into 'foo',
   then the call is not a killing call.  We currently treat it as
   though it is.  */
