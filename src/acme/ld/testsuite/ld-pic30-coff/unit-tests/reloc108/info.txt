reloc108: BFD_RELOC_PIC30_P_DMAOFFSET (general, explicit mapping):

The objective of this test is to verify that
BFD_RELOC_PIC30_P_DMAOFFSET relocations can be
performed on unaligned data elements in dma
memory. DMA sections are
explicitly mapped in the linker script.

Note: This test exercises SSR# 27891.

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $PIC30_CD
    to your xc16 tools binary directory
2. Export $PIC30_CD
3. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
