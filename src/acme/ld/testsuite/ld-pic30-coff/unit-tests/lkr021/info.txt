lkr021: Section .pbss is not initialized:

The objective of this test is to verify that
the persistent data section .pbss is not
initialized by the startup library. Note that
an empty data init template has a size of 2.

Prior to v1.30, this test exercised 3 variations
of the magic name ".pbss" Section .pbss now has
implied attributes that are enforced by the assembler.

For backward compatibility, the linker still
recognizes any section name that contains ".pbss"
and excludes it from the data template.

The following warning message should be generated:

"Warning: Quoted section flags are deprecated,
 use attributes instead"

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $ACME_BIN
    to your xc16 tools binary directory
2. Export $ACME_BIN
3. Edit the Configuration section of file "go"
4. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
