lkr058:  Support for attribute MERGE

The objective of this test is to verify that
sections marked with the MERGE attribute are
handled properly by the linker.

Note: For COFF, merge is not supported in 
the object format, so the attribute should
be silently ignored (its a non-binding
suggestion, after all).

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $PIC30_CD
    to your pic30 tools binary directory
2. Export $PIC30_CD

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
