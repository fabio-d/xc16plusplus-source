lkr061:  Implied attributes for object files (.ybss,"b")

The objective of this test is to verify that
object files created with pre-v1.30 versions
of the tools can be linked properly with the
new linker scripts. In particular, implied
section attributes based on reserved section
names must be supported.

For diagnostic purposes, the undocumented
.flags assembler directive is used to simulate
a v1.20 object file.

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $PIC30_CD
    to your pic30 tools binary directory
2. Export $PIC30_CD

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
