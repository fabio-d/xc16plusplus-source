Running Linker Unit Tests 
=========================

Last updated on 2004-03-29 by GM


The linker uses a test driver written in perl.  The test cases are found in subdirectories under $SRC_DIR/acme/ld/testsuite/ld-pic30-coff/unit-tests. The tests are run as a suite using the following commands:

- cd $SRC_DIR/acme/ld/testsuite/ld-pic30-coff/unit-tests
- perl go

The results will be printed to the screen. Individual test results may be examined like this:

- cd misc18
- chmod a+x go
- ./go

When a test is run individually, diagnostic information remains in the directory and can be viewed. The verbose option will write additional information to the console:

- ./go -v 

Each unit test directory contains a standard set of files with the following naming convention:

  info.txt -- documentation for the unit test
  go --  shell script to run the unit test
  t1.s, t2.s -- source files
  t.lkr -- linker script
  test.out -- output of the test
  expect.out -- expected output
