reloc107: BFD_RELOC_PIC30_DMAOFFSET (general, program memory, unmapped):

The objective of this test is to verify that
BFD_RELOC_PIC30_DMAOFFSET relocations can be
performed on unaligned data elements in dma
memory. The relocated data is allocated in 
program memory. DMA sections are not
explicitly mapped in the linker script.

Note: This test exercises SSR#27892.

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $PIC30_CD
    to your pic30 tools binary directory
2. Export $PIC30_CD
3. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
