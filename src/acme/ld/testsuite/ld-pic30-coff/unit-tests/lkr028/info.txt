lkr028: Multiple READONLY sections [non-overlapping]:

The objective of this test is to verify that
multiple READONLY sections can share the
PSV window with non-overlapping addresses.
Note that a single setting of PSVPAG will allow
both sections to be visible at the same time.

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $ACME_BIN
    to your xc16 tools binary directory
2. Export $ACME_BIN
3. Edit the Configuration section of file "go"
4. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
