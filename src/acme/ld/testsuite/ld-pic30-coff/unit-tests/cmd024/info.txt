cmd024: --no-force-link option:

The objective of this test is to verify that
the linker will emit an error message if
the link target processor has a more
restrictive instruction set than one of
the input objects. The presence of the
--no-force-link linker option should
not change the default behaviour.

1. Set the environment variable $ACME_BIN
    to your pic30 tools binary directory
