misc21: Regression test of SSR# 25916:

The objective of this test is to verify that
the memory usage report correctly accounts
for the vector tables and reset instruction
in computing the % used in program memory,
and that the % used in data memory and data
 EEPROM memory is correct.

Note: on the 30f3014 device, memory ranges
are as follows:

data:    2048 bytes
program: ((8K * 3) - 384) bytes = 24,192 bytes
eedata:  1024 bytes
How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $ACME_BIN
    to your xc16 tools binary directory
2. Export $ACME_BIN
3. Edit the Configuration section of file "go"
4. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
