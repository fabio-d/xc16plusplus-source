misc11: General test of Weak functions and symbols:

The objective of this test is to exercise the "weak"
attribute of functions and symbols; to see if defined
weak functions can be over-ridden quietly, and if
undefined weak symbols become zero with no error.
Tests are performed with three combinations of
object files and archive files.

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $ACME_BIN
    to your pic30 tools binary directory
2. Export $ACME_BIN
3. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
