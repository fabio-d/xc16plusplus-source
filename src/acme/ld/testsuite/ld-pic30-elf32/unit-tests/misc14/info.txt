misc14: Non-aligned relocations:

The objective of this test is to verify that
non-aligned relocations are handled correctly.
In CODE sections, only valid PC offsets should
by displayed by pic30-objdump [-r option]. In
READONLY and DATA sections, normal data addresses
should be displayed. Finally, the output of the
link is checked to make sure all the non-aligned
bytes have been relocated properly.

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $ACME_BIN
    to your pic30 tools binary directory
2. Export $ACME_BIN
3. Edit the Configuration section of file "go"
4. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
