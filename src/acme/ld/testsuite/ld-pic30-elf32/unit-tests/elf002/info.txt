elf002: Section lengths represented in bytes:

The objective of this test is to verify that
section lengths in ELF files are represented
in bytes.

Note: this test shares source code with elf001.

NOTE: This test is supposed to validate
the ELF file independant of BFD.
For now, it does not. The COFF version
uses a stand-alone script for this purpose.

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $PIC30_CD
    to your pic30 CD image directory
2. Export $PIC30_CD
3. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
