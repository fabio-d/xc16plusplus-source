============================
Running Assembler Unit Tests 
============================

Last updated on 2004-03-26 by GM

The assembler will use the DejaGnu Testing Framework to run the unit tests.  
These test cases are found under $SRC_DIR/acme/gas/testsuite/gas/pic30.  The 
main script file is pic30.exp and the source for each unit test case is of the 
format utcxxx.c where xxx corresponds to the test ID).  

The tests may be run with the following commands:

- cd $BIN_DIR/acme
- make check-gas RUNTESTFLAGS="pic30.exp"

The results will be printed to the screen.  The file 
$BIN_DIR/acme/gas/testsuite/gas.sum will contain the list of tests preceded by 
their status. The status will be listed as PASS (passed), XFAIL (expected 
failure), and FAIL (unexpected failure). A summary will be displayed at the end
and will show the expected results and expected failures.  If unexpected 
results occur check to log file for details ($BIN_DIR/acme/gas/testsuite/gas.log)  

Note: utc1113 is expected to pass only for Windows

Historical Info
===============

2004-03-26  The following information was valid (or relevant)
            at some point in the past:


The test file format utcxxx.c where xxx corresponds to the test ID
in the test database 
(located at \\chdldisk\ds_sysapp\data\test\database\gas30\unittst.mdb and 
\\chdldisk\ds_sysapp\data\test\database\gas30\unittst.mdb).

NOTE: Before running the unit tests, the DejaGnu resource file (.dejagnurc) 
must set the path for each tool. DejaGnu does not recognize the environment 
variables so the path must be hard coded for them.  See the example below.

The contents of the file .dejagnurc :

set PIC30_CD "/CDImage"
set PIC30_LOCAL "/usr/local"

set AS $PIC30_CD/bin/pic30-as
set GASP $PIC30_LOCAL/bin/pic30-gasp
set OBJDUMP $PIC30_CD/bin/pic30-objdump
set NM $PIC30_CD/bin/pic30-nm
set OBJCOPY $PIC30_LOCAL/bin/pic30-objcopy
